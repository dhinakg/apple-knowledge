  BORD:
    description: |-
      The board the chip is attached to.  With iPhones/iPads this is the variation between device sizes (occasionally
      also used for low cost devices like the SE/XR).  This is usually expressed as a hex encoded uint8_t.  Some
      types of board seem to encode a bitfield for non MP (mainline production) boards such as EVT/DVT

      With the T2 this value is unique to all MacBooks with the T2.
